    "title": "1868 velocipede",
    "description": "Pierre Michaux, his son Ernest and business partners, in Paris, were the first commercial makers of pedal bicycles, in the mid to late 1860s. At the time the vehicles were called velocipedes. Competitors began to build velocipedes as well, and this example could be by one of them.\n\nCranks and pedals are on the front wheel, a direct-drive system. One turn of the pedals takes you the circumference of the wheel. This velocipede's 36-inch drive wheel provides a very low gear compared to bicycles of today. Cradles above the front wheel (forward of the head tube) allowed riders to rest their legs when coasting down hills. A handlebar-operated rear brake provided some (marginal) sense of safety.\n\nThe Calcium King acetylene lantern shown on the velocipede is from a different period -  the 1890s — and is now displayed separately.",

Rudge patented his adjustable ball bearings in 1878 and they were sold to his competitors for many years. Rudge bearings and William Bown's \"Aeolus\" bearings, made for early bicycles, are the grandparents of the ball bearings used throughout industry today.\nBoston's Stoddard, Lovering & Co. was the importer for the \"American Rudge.\"\nGearing: 53 inches (driving wheel diameter)",

Eisentraut, sometimes called America's bicycle renaissance frame builder, had trained in the 1950s in Chicago under Emil and Oscar Wastyn, famed for their 6-Day racing frames of the 1930 and 1950s, some made for the Schwinn Paramount mark. \nThis frame's slim, tapered lug work might be termed \"Eisentraut school.\" Eisentraut introduced numerous American frame builders to this method of dissipating stress across a lugged frame. While time consuming, it can make a  frame stronger and lighter. \nBreeze raced road bikes throughout the 1970s and made custom frames for Velo Club Tamalpais members and others. He built this frame for teammate Marc Vendetti. In 1977 Breeze's frame building experience would come in handy, as he and others in the local off-road movement had a need for stronger/lighter frames for riding up and down Mount Tamalpais.",

In 1983, Phelan's partner and future husband Charlie Cunningham created the R1 race bike specifically for her. Dubbed “Otto,” the bike was the main form of transportation for car-less Phelan. Cunningham’s heat-treated, thin-walled aluminum frame ensured a lifetime’s worthiness over rough terrain at high speeds, while giving Phelan the distinct advantage of a bike that was lighter and stiffer than other racing mountain bikes. Otto’s double (instead of triple) chainring and modified rear cogset with eleven-tooth gear helped reduce the bike’s overall weight and reflected Cunningham’s impulse for efficiency through simplification. \n     Although the industry routinely disparaged aluminum as a durable frame material, Phelan’s longtime success on an unbroken frame challenged the critics. Cunningham’s patented Type II fork and Roller-Cam brakes added to the advantages Phelan had at her disposal.

In 1976 he set up his own framebuilding shop, first in Eugene, Oregon, and then in 1988 in Petaluma, California. Gordon was known for his exquisite custom touring frames, and his luggage racks.\n     In 1988, Gordon’s friend Gary Helfrich (co-founder of Merlin Titanium) found a 700 x 47mm (28 x 1.75”) tire in Finland. At the time, mountain bike tires were uniformly 26-inch diameter. That year, Gordon started producing his rugged Rock’n Road touring bikes, using these 28-inch Nokian Haakapeliitta tires. He eventually produced his own similar tires called Rock’n Road. \n     In 1993, Ibis welder Wes Williams, the instigator (in 1988) of big wheels for mountain bikes, joined Gordon to make two titanium off-road bikes based on the Rock’n Road tire. Williams welded the frames, while Gordon machined steep crowns to adapt Rock Shox forks. The bike on display here was ridden by Gordon for many years. Having 1.7” wide tires, the two bikes weren’t quite mountain bikes, but they built believers in big-wheel mountain biking.",
